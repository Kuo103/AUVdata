The acquired dataset consists of raw measurements stored in MATLAB format and requires subsequent filtering and preprocessing.
• PWM_True_Store: Recorded PWM input signals applied to the thrusters
• direct_pos_store: Measured AUV position data
• IMUdata: Timestamped IMU measurements collected from the AUV
